# SmartShala Frontend

A EduTech app, for streamlining the process of taking and grading tests for school students, automating the cumbersome process of manually checking each answer sheet. Scans the MCQ sheet to determine the score of the student, and assign it to the teacher's dashboard.

Made for in the __Smart India Hackathon Finals 2022__, held in Excel College, Coimbatore and gained positive feedback from judges and finished second.

_Currently only the frontend (UI) is functional, all the api calls present but **disabled** to allow a full unlocked view into the app._
